      <p>Giorno Giovanna (ジョルノ・ジョバァーナ Joruno Jobāna) is the protagonist of Vento Aureo. He is the fifth JoJo of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series.

Giorno is the illegitimate son of DIO, conceived with Jonathan Joestar's stolen body. He is introduced as Haruno Shiobana (汐華 初流乃), a half-Japanese teenager living in ItalyW. He speaks of his intention to join the powerful gang Passione and his dream of becoming a "Gang-Star" (combining "Gangster" and "Superstar") to restore virtue to the corrupt mafia.

Giorno is a natural-born Stand User wielding the life-giving Gold Experience in battle.  </p>
<h1>Stand: Gold Experience</h1>
<img class="bild_rum1" src="img/gold-experience.png" alt="Gold Experinece">
<p>Gold Experience is a humanoid Stand of slender build and average height, like Giorno. The top of its head is similar to that of a typical helmet of a soldier, with curved markings similar to the letter J coming down from the eyes on both sides. There are stylized wings on its shoulders and large ladybugsW all over its body, which seem to parallel the ladybug emblems present on Giorno's design.

Its design is based on the scarab beetle, as a symbol of creation in ancient Egypt, and on ladybugs, symbolizing regeneration, with its angel wings as a symbol of peace.[1]

It wears slings, similar to the suspenders on DIO's pants.

Befitting its name, Gold Experience is portrayed in most media featuring it in a shade of yellow, but changing colors for some of its details, most notably its ladybugs ornaments.</p>
