      <p>Josuke Higashikata (東方 仗助, Higashikata Jōsuke; the Suke — 助 — in his name may also be pronounced as "Jo") is the protagonist of Diamond is Unbreakable and the fourth JoJo of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series.

Josuke is a high school first-year residing in the town of Morioh. He soon meets Jotaro Kujo, who informs him that he is Joseph Joestar's illegitimate son. After his grandfather dies, Josuke takes it upon himself to protect his beloved town from malevolent Stand users. Josuke wields Crazy Diamond, a powerful Stand with the power to repair almost anything.</p>

    <p> and light blue or silver armour.

During his first appearance, it had multiple irides with a ripple-pattern on its eyes, and its "flesh" and armour seemed to be inverted in which layer of it they resided on, giving its "flesh" the appearance of some sort of membrane. Toward the end of part 4</p><br><br><br>
<p>Crazy Diamond is humanoid, with a powerful build and tall stature (about two heads above Josuke).

It is clad in tall headgear, part of a mask (occasionally resembling a Corinthian helmetW); and armour-like plates on many large surfaces of its body, similar to the armour seen on The World. Cables join the back of its head to its upper back. It bears a heart motif between the top of its head, its chin, shoulders, celiac plexus, belt, and knees; with pairs of short spikes protruding from its shoulders and ankles.

Its most common colour scheme consists of a bubblegum pink interior and light blue or silver armour.</p>
